# üß† Human GPU Exercises.

‚ùóÔ∏è Super beta ‚ùóÔ∏è

A series of exercises that aims to teach the basic of the WebGL/OpenGL pipeline.
The excercises are made to be printed and done in old-fashion **pen and paper**.

It's a hands on experiments, where WebGL features are introduced incrementally and where exercises are meant to be done in the correct order.
